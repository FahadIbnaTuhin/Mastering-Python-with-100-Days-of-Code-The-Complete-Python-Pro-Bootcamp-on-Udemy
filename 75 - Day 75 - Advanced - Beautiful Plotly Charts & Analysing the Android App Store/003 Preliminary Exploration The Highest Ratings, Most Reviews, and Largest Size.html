        <p><strong>Challenge</strong>: Identify which apps are the highest rated. What problem might you encounter if you rely exclusively on ratings alone to determine the quality of an app?</p><p><strong>Challenge</strong>: What's the size in megabytes (MB) of the largest Android apps in the Google Play Store. Based on the data, do you think there could be a limit in place or can developers make apps as large as they please?</p><p><strong>Challenge</strong>: Which apps have the highest number of reviews? Are there any paid apps among the top 50?</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>..</p><p></p><p>..</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Solution: Preliminary Data Exploration</strong></p><p>This challenge should have been fairly straightforward if you remembered to use the .sort_values() function.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">df_apps_clean.sort_values('Rating', ascending=False).head()</pre><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-10_11-53-34-1d863b2b858ea3ad7e526a9651cf7d55.png"></figure><p>Only apps with very few reviews (and a low number on installs) have perfect 5 star ratings (most likely by friends and family).</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">df_apps_clean.sort_values('Size_MBs', ascending=False).head()</pre><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-10-10_11-53-57-9721337e76ececb8d5b1d45da3fd250f.png"></figure><p>Here we can clearly see that there seems to be an upper bound of 100 MB for the size of an app. A quick google search would also have revealed that this limit is imposed by the Google Play Store itself.

These include the usual suspects: Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram etc. Whats also notable is that the list of the top 50 most reviewed apps does not include a single paid app! </p>
